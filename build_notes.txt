Notes to myself about the build process


- Auth using plink (putty agent) and may have to manually select the key to open to get it to work
  This solves: "fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly" during push/pull. Uses a ppk file.

- Test in Chrome by loading an unpacked extension.  Point it directly to the eclipse workspace's folder.
