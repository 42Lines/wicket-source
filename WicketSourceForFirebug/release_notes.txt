Remaining work to do:
* Right-click menu on an element, "Inspect in Eclipse" that takes you directly there.
* Properly handle update of the panel when the user changes options
* Make Eclipse portion collapsible ala Computed tab
* Backport the Options screen to support Firefox 5 & 6
* Ensure proper behavior in the condition where the user is hand-modifying the wicketsource attribute
* Provide how-to-use readme with a web page where the extension can be downloaded/installed.

10/23/2011 - Code overhaul, fixed bugs with multiple tabs, added comments.
 - Fixed handling for multiple tabs since that dorked up firefox when I launched a second tab accidentally.
 - Cleaned up OO Javascript; prior code had namespace and scope problems and was rather sloppy.
 - Made the project name more consistently used in variables.
 - Commented all major methods and variables.

10/19/2011 - WicketSource Firebug extension basically works.
 - Displays 'wicketsource' attribute value in a side panel of the HTML inspector
 - Displays server, port, timeout configuration
 - User can modify Options through Add-on options (Firefox 7 only) to change server, port, timeout
 - Get project into git
