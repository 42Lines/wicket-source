Remaining work to do:
* For release: Provide how-to-use readme with a web page where the extension can be downloaded/installed.
* Update Options page to show the right web addresses instead of www.example.com

Later enhancements:
* Usability improvement; right-click menu on an element, "Inspect in Eclipse" that takes you directly there.
* Backport the Options screen to support Firefox 5 & 6

12/11/2011 - Improved content filtering to reduce the likelihood of script injection.

10/27/2011 - Minor fixes.
 - Made default port match the Eclipse plugin.
 - Handling of "" and ":" as wicketsource, and also source file when package is blank, since parsing was incorrect

10/23/2011 - Code overhaul, fixed bugs with multiple tabs, added comments.
 - Fixed handling for multiple tabs since that dorked up firefox when I launched a second tab accidentally.
 - Cleaned up OO Javascript; prior code had namespace and scope problems and was rather sloppy.
 - Made the project name more consistently used in variables.
 - Commented all major methods and variables.
 - Display simplification, since I no longer need the port information onscreen at all times.
 - Validated handling of manually modified wicketsource attribute.

10/19/2011 - WicketSource Firebug extension basically works.
 - Displays 'wicketsource' attribute value in a side panel of the HTML inspector
 - Displays server, port, timeout configuration
 - User can modify Options through Add-on options (Firefox 7 only) to change server, port, timeout
 - Get project into git
