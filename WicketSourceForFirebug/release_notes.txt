Remaining work to do:
* Clean up OO Javascript; current code has namespace and scope problems and is rather sloppy.
* Provide how-to-use readme with a web page where the extension can be downloaded/installed.
* Properly handle update of the panel when the user changes options
* Backport the Options screen to support Firefox 5 & 6
* Rename project if needed, or at least make the name more consistently used in variables.
* Make Eclipse portion collapsible ala Computed tab
* Ensure proper behavior in the condition where the user is hand-modifying the wicketsource attribute
* Get project into git

10/19/2011 - WicketSource Firebug extension basically works.
 - Displays 'wicketsource' attribute value in a side panel of the HTML inspector
 - Displays server, port, timeout configuration
 - User can modify Options through Add-on options (Firefox 7 only) to change server, port, timeout
