Remaining:
* Provide user settings for: # recent files to list, projects to search, start listener on startup.
* Modify search to just look in the user-specified projects (should reduce multiple-hits).
* Produce a UI dialog and ask for a user to choose in cases where multiple hits occur; modeled after Open Type dialog.
* Test thoroughly with error handling for non-existent files.
* Package the build properly for release on a Eclipse update site. Check into version management.
