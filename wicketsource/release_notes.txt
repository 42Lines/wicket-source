Remaining:
* Test whether the listening service remains on once the view is closed (it should).
* Clean up formatting of Recent File Locations tab. Preferably use a table layout.
* Show a message on each OpenEvent line that failed, showing the "Warning: Not found" message but clearing it if it works on reopen.
* Create preferences pane. Provide user settings for: 
  port number, # recent files to list, projects to search, start listener on startup.
* Modify search to just look in the user-specified projects (should reduce multiple-hits).
* Produce a UI dialog and ask for a user to choose in cases where multiple hits occur; modeled after Open Type dialog.
* Test thoroughly with error handling for non-existent files.
* Package the build properly for release on a Eclipse update site. Check into version management.


10/21/2011 - Basic functionality works.
 - Listener service starts and stops from green/red UI buttons (but port is hard-coded).
 - Http requests result in a correctly opened file and go to line number.  
 - Double clicking an open event line in the Recent File Locations view reopens that file.
 - Plugin installs as a drop-in jar on Eclipse Indigo.
