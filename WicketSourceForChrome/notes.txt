The WicketSource plugin scans wicket application pages (typically those being worked on
by the developer running the browser), looks for wicketsource="com.mycompany.whatever.MyWicketPanel:35"
type labels, displays a brief html panel in the devtools pane, and its link produces an http request 
back to an IDE listener that opens the named source code to that line of the file.  

It's a convenience tool for Wicket developers, during development.

Future:
* Upgrade to manifest v2, fix inline javascript and possibly make the IDE listen on https; set manifest permissions to match.

In Progress:
* Submit to Chrome Web Store.

Done
